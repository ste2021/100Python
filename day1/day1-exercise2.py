# Fix the code below
st_mais = "\"+\""
st_hello = "\"Hello \""
st_world = "\"world\""

# 1 - Missing double quotes before the word Day.
# print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")

# 2 - Outer double quotes changed to single quotes.
# print(f'String Concatenation is done with the {st_mais} sign.')
print(f'String Concatenation is done with the {st_mais} sign.')

# 3 - Extra indentation removed
# print(f'e.g. print({st_hello} + {st_world})')
print(f'e.g. print({st_hello} + {st_world})')

# 4 - Extra (in print function removed)
# print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
